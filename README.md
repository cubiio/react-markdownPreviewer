# Markdown Previewer

A simple React.js app which renders markdown input as HTML.

## Project Info

The idea for this project came from Free Code Camp as part of their React projects:

- [FreeCodeCamp: Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer)

The _user stories_ are as follows:

- I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

- I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

A **demo** of the app is available [here](https://build-cneetxakhr.now.sh/), using [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now).
